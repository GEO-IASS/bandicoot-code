* Bandicoot is C++ GPU library for linear algebra, using expression templates to automatically choose optimal OpenCL / CUDA kernels for increased performance

* Bandicoot is an extension of the [Armadillo C++ library](http://arma.sourceforge.net)

* Bandicoot aims to provide the same API and syntax as the [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html), but targeting matrices and vectors stored in GPU accessible memory
