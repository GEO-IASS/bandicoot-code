# About
* Bandicoot is C++ GPU library for linear algebra, interfacing OpenCL / CUDA
* Bandicoot aims to provide the same API and syntax as the [Armadillo library](http://arma.sourceforge.net), but using matrices and vectors stored in GPU accessible memory
* Bandicoot is currently a work-in-progress and hence unstable


# Requirements (subject to change)
* OpenCL 1.2+ (note: CUDA provides OpenCL even though NVIDIA doesn't advertise this)
* clBLAS 2.12+ - https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS
* Armadillo 7.800+ - http://arma.sourceforge.net


# Developers
* Conrad Sanderson - http://conradsanderson.id.au
