* Bandicoot is C++ GPU library for linear algebra, interfacing OpenCL / CUDA

* Bandicoot aims to provide the same API and syntax as the [Armadillo library](http://arma.sourceforge.net), but using matrices and vectors stored in GPU accessible memory

* Bandicoot is currently a work-in-progress and hence unstable
