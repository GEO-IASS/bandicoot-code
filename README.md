**About**
* Bandicoot is C++ a linear algebra library for GPUs, interfacing OpenCL / CUDA
* Bandicoot aims to provide the same API and syntax as the [Armadillo library](http://arma.sourceforge.net), but using matrices and vectors stored in GPU accessible memory
* Bandicoot is currently a **work-in-progress** and hence currently only for experimental use
<br>
<br>

**Requirements** (subject to change)
* OpenCL 1.2+ (note: CUDA provides OpenCL even though NVIDIA doesn't advertise this)
* clBLAS 2.12+ https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS
* Armadillo 7.800+ http://arma.sourceforge.net
